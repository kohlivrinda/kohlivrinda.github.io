Hi! I'm Vrinda, a final year Computer Science undergraduate with a Data Science minor. My current reseach interests lie in Trustworthy (and private) ML along with NLP. I am also quite curious about Theory of Mind. 

Most of my prior experience is in Computer Vision and I am actively applying for Fall'24 PhD programs.
