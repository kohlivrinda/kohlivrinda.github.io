Hi! I'm Vrinda, a final year Computer Science undergraduate with a Data Science minor. I am currently developing LLM based solutions for the HRTech world at [Gloroots](https://www.gloroots.com/) as an ML intern.

My research interests lie within Differential Privacy and Algorithmic Fairness, and I'm always up for a chat and/or collaborations on projects around the field. Currently I am slowly but steadily trying to replicate various adversarial attacks as a side project.

When I am not pouring over my keyboard, I enjoy reading. Right now, I am hooked onto Katie Mack's 'The End of Everything', a fantastic read if you're interested in cosmic doomdays.
